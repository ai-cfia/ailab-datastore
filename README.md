# nachet-dataformat

## Overview

We want to define a human editable metadata format associated to captured images of seeds for model training and analysis.

Capturing attributes associated to the images is essential for proper model training.

## csv vs yaml vs json file

There are three machine readable file formats that are popular:

* [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values): often as an export of spreadsheet, each row is a single piece of data with columnar
* [json](https://www.json.org/): json is a standard for modern API dataformat, it defines a dictionary of keys and values with datatypes matching Javascript datatypes but now supported in most languages
* [yaml](https://yaml.org/).YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages
