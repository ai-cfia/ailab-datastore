# Bytebase

## Context

We are storing our database architecture in a folder named bytebase.
[Bytebase](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/introduction/what-is-bytebase/) is a
version management tool for database, just like github. It also enables us to
connect to a database server on a cloud service. This is important because the
network policy we are working under doesn't allow us to make connection on port
1532.
