## Observation

- The process of the user requesting the Subscription Access Key and obtaining it is not really efficient. The Dev hav to manually create Storage space, the key is sent by email and no information links the user to the storage space. It would be interesting to have a SOP (standard operating procedure)
  
- Alot of time can be spent on wrong file structure. We need to implement our file structure at the source (User). We also need more doc or SOP on how to deal with wrongfully structured file set.
