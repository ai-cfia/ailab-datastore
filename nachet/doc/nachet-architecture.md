# Database Architecture
  
## Needs

- A User must be able to take a picture on the app and it must be saved in the
  blob Storage.

- A User can upload a batch on pictures.

- A User can classify a picture with a selected pipeline which returns an
  inference that needs to be saved.
  
- A User can verify an inference by confirming the positive result, select the
  right seed from the topN result set (technically it shouldn't be the first
  one) or select a seed that isn't part of the topN.

- The application needs to save a list of known seeds.

- The application needs to save a list of all the Machine Learning versions.
