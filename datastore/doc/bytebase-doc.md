# Bytebase

## Context

We are storing our database architecture in a folder named bytebase.
[Bytebase](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/introduction/what-is-bytebase/) is a
version management tool for database, just like github. It also enables us to
connect to a database server on a cloud service. This is important because the
network policy we are working under doesn't allow us to make connection on port.

## Decision

To view the architectural decision record behind Bytebase refer [to the following ADR](https://github.com/ai-cfia/dev-rel-docs/tree/main/adr/006-review-database-change-management.md)

## Usage documentation

Refer [to the following documentation](https://github.com/ai-cfia/dev-rel-docs/tree/main/Bytebase/usage-guideline.md) to better understand how Bytebase works and how to use its features.
